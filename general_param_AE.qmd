As optimizers I left what was already there, so AdamW.

I used different learning rates during the previous training but in general:

-   0.0001 the first 3 epochs
-   0.00006 between 4 and 10 epochs
-   0.00003 between 11 and 20 epochs
-   0.00001 after 21 epochs

The higher learning rate at the beginning is used to speed up the training while the lower learning rate at the end is to fine tune the model.

I slightly decreased Î²~1~ to help lowering the learning rate.

I decreased weight decay too, to be consistent with the lower learning rate.
