ConcePTION[see @ConcePTION] is an IMI project which began in 2019. As one of the project outputs, ConcePTION aimed to establish a trusted ecosystem that generates and disseminates reliable, evidence-based information regarding effects of medication used during pregnancy and breastfeeding. To this end, a CDM was designed to manage, within constrained timelines and budget, the heterogeneity inherent in the diverse data sources in Europe.

The ConcePTION CDM includes 16 tables. Each table includes multiple variables. The picture below summarises the ConcePTION CDM.

As you can see, the tables have four different colours. The colours indicate the four types of data tables:

-   Green: Routine healthcare data, such as data related to medical events (diagnoses/symptoms), medicines, vaccines, medical procedures and medical observations.
-   Dark blue: Surveillance data, such as registries (birth registries, congenital anomaly registries, disease registries, ...), surveys or cohorts.
-   Light blue: Curated data, such as demographics, observation periods and person relationships (e.g., mother/child linkage).
-   Grey: Metadata, i.e., information regarding the data in the model, such as extraction dates and drugs detailed definition.

Linkages between the different tables are represented by lines:

-   Solid black lines: The linkages across records of the same person (e.g., patient demographics from Persons table to diagnosis codes from Events table).
-   Dotted lines: The linkages across items extracted from the same record (e.g., hospital stays from Visit occurrence table to diagnosis codes from Events table).
-   Solid grey lines: The linkages from items referring to a medicinal product or vaccines to the full product description in the Product table.

A data instance of a CDM refers to a set of structured data that conforms to the predefined schema and semantics.

To train the AE-WGAN-GP I used synthetic data since for privacy concerns I could used real data.

The instance I used is available [here](https://github.com/dado330/AE-WGAN-GP/tree/main/R_preprocessing/i_input_subpop).
