title: "Setup on Drive"
---

The first thing I did was copying what I already have done inside cells on Colab. I then uploaded my input dataset on the VM and modified the path inside the script.

After a day has passed with me cleaning the script and rerunning the AutoEncoder on Colab I found out the VM state is not saved once you are disconnected from it.

The easiest solution and the one sponsored By Google is to use Google Drive.

Next, I uploaded the input data on my Google Drive which is then mounted the VM on Colab using the following command (and by giving many permissions)

``` python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount(‘/content/gdrive’)
```

I changed again the path to the input files (and checkpoints) and rerun again the AutoEncoder.
