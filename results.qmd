Using the Generator I created a dataset 1000 times larger than the initial one.

![10000 Times didn't work...](10000x.png){fig-align="center"}

The Generator is not perfect so some of its output contains only 0. Since that is clearly impossible I decided to remove those rows. In total they were less than 2% of the generated dataset.

I then calculated the mean number of cases for each events I would get if I generated a dataset of the same size as the initial one

| C_CAD_AESI                     | 31.0   | 31.479591   | -1.55     |     |
| C_MYOCARD_AESI                 | 20.0   | 17.986734   | 10.07     |     |
| C_VALVULAR_AESI                | 50.0   | 51.130611   | -2.26     |     |
| DEATH                          | 258.0  | 253.684692  | 1.67      |     |

| E_DM1_AESI                     | 38.0   | 44.208164   | -16.34    |     |
| E_GOUT_AESI                    | 27.0   | 25.344898   | 6.13      |     |
| G_KIACUTE_AESI                 | 15.0   | 14.710204   | 1.93      |     |
| G_UTI_AESI                     | 23.0   | 23.219387   | -0.95     |     |

| M_FRACTURES_AESI               | 60.0   | 59.522449   | 0.80      |     |
| M_OSTEOARTHRITIS_AESI          | 28.0   | 27.116327   | 3.16      |     |
| N_STROKEHEMO_AESI              | 10.0   | 9.992857    | 0.07      |     |
| SO_OTITISEXT_AESI              | 36.0   | 37.114285   | -3.10     |     |
| V_THROMBOSISARTERIALALGOR_AESI | 45.0   | 45.730614   | -1.62     |     |
| V_VTEALGORITHM_AESI            | 19.0   | 19.263266   | -1.39     |     |

The script reproduce well most of the variables. However D_PANCRACUTE_AESI, C_MYOCARD_AESI and I_INFLUENZA_AESI are slightly underrepresented in the generated data, while E_DM1_AESI on the other hand is over represented.

The Mean Square Error is 5.63 which is good enough in this case.

Finally I wantef to see the number of events each persons has:

| Number of events | 0_real | 0_synthetic | diff_perc |
|------------------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| 1.0              | 639    | 639.180612  | -0.03     |
| 2.0              | 52     | 52.792857   | -1.52     |
| 3.0              | 28     | 27.562245   | 1.56      |

The script does a very good job in this case. I removed the impossible cases when the person has 0 events but even with that taken into account the performance does not drop much.

The Mean Square Error is only 0.28 which is very good.
